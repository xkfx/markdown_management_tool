<p>This is the real madness, because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward, but we talk about love as if this is true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reconcile this, we need to either change our culture or change our expectations. So, imagine if we were all less passive in love. If we were more assertive, more open-mined, more generous and instead of falling in love, we stepped into love. I know that this is asking a lot, but I'm not actually the first person to suggest this. In their book, "Metaphors We Live By," linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma,&nbsp;<strong>which is to change our metaphors.</strong>&nbsp;They argue<strong>&nbsp;that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world</strong>, and that they can even act as a guide for future actions, like self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love:<strong>&nbsp;love as a collaborative work of art.</strong>&nbsp;I really like this way of thinking about love. Linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments, which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of, or ideas contained within, a given metaphor. And Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails: effort, compromise, patience, shared goals. These ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long-term romantic commitment, but they also work well for other kinds of relationships -- short-term, casual, polyamorous, non-monogamous, asexual -- because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if love is a collaborative work of art, then love is an aesthetic experience. Love is unpredictable, love is creative, love requires communication and discipline, it is frustrating and emotionally demanding. And love involves both joy and pain. Ultimately, each experience of love is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This version of love is not about winning or losing someone's affection. Instead, it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult, which sounds so simple, but is actually a kind of revolutionary, radical act. This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you're gaining or losing in your relationship, and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer. This version of love allows us to say things like, "Hey, we're not very good collaborators. Maybe this isn't for us." Or, "That relationship was shorter than I had planned, but it was still kind of beautiful."</p>
