<p>1.&nbsp;I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question, which is, "How do we make people pay for music?" What if we started asking, "How do we let people pay for music?"&nbsp;-- Is there any difference? ??</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers, our mistakes, and we see each other. And I think when we really see each other, we want to help each other.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;it <strong>took a toll</strong> on my body and on my mind. 付出代价，造成伤害</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;My mind would suddenly <strong>lock into this spinning cycle of terror</strong> and no matter how I hard I tried to calm myself down or <strong>reason my way out of it</strong>, I couldn't do it.&nbsp; 陷（锁）入恐怖的旋转循环（死循环？）； 寻找、推理我的出路</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;being afraid of being afraid <strong>consumed all of my thoughts. </strong>耗尽了我所有的想法</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Every time someone asks me, "How could you not have known?",<strong> it feels like a punch in the gut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>就像是在肠道（肚子？）上锤了一拳</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;I've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can, we cannot know or control everything our loved ones think and feel, and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different, that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else, can cause us <strong>to miss what's hidden in plain sight.&nbsp; </strong>错过隐藏在明显景象中的东西； <strong>in plain sight </strong>众目睽睽之下</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;a life of <strong>permanent penance</strong> 永久忏悔</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>We should always assume that someone we love may be suffering, regardless of what they say or how they act. We should listen with our whole being, without judgments, and without offering solutions.&nbsp;我们应该总是假设我们所爱的人可能正承受痛苦，无论他们（表面上）怎么说、怎么做。 我们应该认真去倾听，而不是急着去判断，或者（武断地）给予解决方案。</p>
<p>8. In the end what I know <strong>comes down to this</strong>:&nbsp;the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to help, but for love's sake, we must never stop trying to know the unknowable. 在最后我所知道的是：悲惨的事实是，即便我们再警惕、再负责任，（我们）可能都没办法提供（及时）帮助，但是由于爱的缘故，我们绝不能停止尝试去知道那些不可知的东西。</p>
