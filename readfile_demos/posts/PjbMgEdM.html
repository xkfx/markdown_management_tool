<p>noticed a haze hanging over the city<br />/<br />Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning.<br />/<br />Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving big problems within that domain<br />/<br />Sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in <strong>unconventional thinking that can move the needle</strong>, but you need to be bold enough to try. <br />/<br />So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that there's some natural curiosity you have that is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or bold ideas, and perhaps it's outside the <strong>realm</strong> of your <strong>expertise</strong>, ask yourself this: Why not? Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way? <strong>You may be pleasantly surprised.</strong></p>

<p>注意到城市上空笼罩着阴霾<br />/<br />约翰内斯堡以其独特的天际线而闻名，那天早上我几乎看不到它。<br />/<br />即使您不是特定领域的专家，您的外部专业知识也可能是解决该领域内的大问题的关键<br />/<br />有时候，你所拥有的独特视角会导致非常规思维的移动，但你需要勇于尝试。<br />/</p>
<p>所以，不论你身在何处，下一次你发现你内心深处的某种好奇心被激起，那正好是你所关心的事情，并且你有一些疯狂、大胆的想法，也许它超出了你专业知识的范围，问问你自己：为什么不呢？ 为什么不直接按照自己的方式尽力解决问题呢？ 也许会有一些意想不到的惊喜等着你哦～</p>
