<p>1. what was it like being in America during the recent <strong>presidential election</strong> 总统选举</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;And one way into it is to see that perhaps the most simple way into a culture and into an age is to ask: What do people <strong>worship</strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp;崇拜</p>
<p>3. people worshipped the nation, <strong>the Aryan race</strong>,<strong> the communist state</strong>. What do we worship? I think future <strong>anthropologists</strong> will take a look at the books we read on self-help, <strong>self-realization, self-esteem</strong>. They'll look at the way we talk about <strong>morality</strong> as being true to oneself, 雅利安人种族； 共产主义国家； 人类学家；自我实现，自尊； 道德</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;and they'll look at this wonderful new <strong>religious ritual</strong> we have created.&nbsp;宗教仪式</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;You know the one? Called the "<strong>selfie.</strong>"&nbsp;自拍</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;And this is great. It's <strong>liberating</strong>. It's <strong>empowering</strong>. It's wonderful. 解放的； 赋予权力的</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we do that, and when we move from the politics of me to the politics of all of us together, we rediscover those beautiful, <strong>counterintuitive</strong> truths: that a nation is strong when it cares for the weak, that it becomes rich when it cares for the poor, it becomes invulnerable when it cares about the vulnerable. That is what makes great nations. 反直觉的</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;So here is my simple suggestion. It might just change your life, and it might just help to begin to change the world. Do a search and replace operation on the text of your mind, and wherever you encounter the word "self," substitute the word "other." So instead of self-help, other-help; instead of self-esteem, other-esteem. And if you do that, you will begin to feel the power of what for me is one of the most moving sentences in all of<strong> religious literature</strong>. "<strong>Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.</strong>" We can face any future without fear so long as we know we will not face it alone. 宗教文献；&nbsp;虽然我走过死亡阴影的山谷，但我不害怕，因为你与我同在。（另译：尽管我走过死亡阴影的河谷，我不会畏惧邪恶，因为你在我身边）</p>
